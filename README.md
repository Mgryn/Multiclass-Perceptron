# Multiclass Perceptron

## Overview:

The program containg Perceptron class, which is a versy simple neural network for binary classification.
In order to use it for classification for larger number of classes, One-Versus-Rest method was implemented.

The model was trained on well-known Iris dataset, using all attributes (sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width) and all 150 items belonging to three available classes - Setosa, Versicolor and Virginica. 

## Requirements:

* Python 3
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* Scikit-learn
